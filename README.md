Comparative study of Time series forecasting models vs Large Language models (LLM) to predict crypto price changes. To prove/disprove hypothesis of a research paper by a group of AI researchers that LLM models would exceed time series models in predicting forecast values. I am predicting values for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple XRP coin.
